# PHASE_TRACKER.md

> **The shared board for the Execution Loop.** Claude (frontend) and codex
> (backend) both read and write it, one row per phase, one row per hi-fi screen.
> Opened 2026-08-21.
>
> Companions: `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md` says what each phase must DO,
> `EXECUTION_SCALE_AND_REFINE.md` says what it must survive, and this file says
> where each one actually IS.

## How to use it

- **Claude** updates the FE column and §4/§5. Frontend work never waits on a
  backend row being green — components are built against props, and props come
  from spec, not from an endpoint (see §3).
- **codex** updates the BE column and §6. §6 is the request queue: every
  `BR-EX-*` a phase needs, with the phase it unblocks.
- Neither side marks a phase `DONE` without evidence in the Evidence column.
  A gate that has not run is not a gate.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DONE` | Merged with green gates, evidence recorded |
| `WIP` | In progress this slice |
| `READY` | Unblocked, not started |
| `BLOCKED` | Waiting on a named dependency |
| `—` | Not applicable to that side |

¹ Phase 6's drawer shell, state machine and blocking rules are already built and
tested (§4). What is blocked is wiring it to a real command endpoint — the
screen can be assembled against fixtures the moment its catalogue is agreed.

---

## 2. Phase 0 — what landed

Built on branch `feat/execution_loop`. Scope was the component half of Phase 0;
the nav half is blocked (§6).

**Carbon isolation.** `[data-theme="operations-carbon"]` in `tokens.css`, applied
by `src/execution/ExecutionSurface.tsx` to a wrapper element rather than to
`<html>`. Custom properties set on that wrapper win for its subtree, so an
Execution token physically cannot reach a Research screen. This was the owner's
option 1, chosen over route-scoping precisely because it converts "do not touch
Research" from a discipline into a structural fact.

**Evidence:**

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx vitest run` | **415 passed**, 1 skipped, 34 files (baseline was 383/33) |
| `npm run build` | clean |
| `scripts/portal-web-visual.sh` | **101 passed**, zero drift |

The visual gate is the one that matters here: 46 of those baselines are
operations-theme Research screens, and none of them moved.

## 3. Why frontend does not wait for backend

Every component below takes props whose shape is transcribed from a document
that already exists, so wiring them later is a mapping exercise rather than a
redesign. Recorded here so the parallelism is auditable rather than assumed:

| Prop shape | Source |
|---|---|
| `Envelope` — authority, as_of, source_sequence, freshness, warnings | `EXECUTION_CLUSTER_GUIDE` §5 |
| `ChartEnvelope` — 13 caption fields | spec v0.7 §16.2 |
| `PromotionStage`, `RuntimeState`, `Readiness`, `BrokerSync` | spec v0.7 §5.2 |
| `StrategyId`/`DeploymentId`/`AccountId`/`PortfolioId`/`ExternalAccountRef` | DB schema guide, layers 2/3/5/9 |

`src/execution/contracts.ts` is the transcription. If codex publishes a field
name that differs, the fix is that file, not the seventeen screens.

---

## 4. Shared component inventory

All in `apps/portal/frontend/src/execution/`. Every one renders in every state
on the fixture page at `/execution/_fixtures` (not a registry feature, not in
nav — it is the Phase 0 exit gate, not a product screen).

| Component | File | Enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthorityBadge` | `components/badges.tsx` | DERIVED without a formula version is stated, not omitted |
| `FreshnessIndicator` | `components/badges.tsx` | PAUSED ≠ STALE — a closed venue is not a fault |
| `StatusChip` + order/operation/runtime/sync variants | `components/badges.tsx` | PARTIAL never green, in either vocabulary |
| `EnvironmentBadge` | `components/badges.tsx` | canary reads `LIVE · CANARY`, never `CANARY` |
| `GuardBand` | `components/lifecycle.tsx` | canary double border, live solid, same hue (D2) |
| `LifecycleRail` + `stageRail` | `components/lifecycle.tsx` | the rail reaches back to R1/R2 |
| `ObservationProgress` | `components/lifecycle.tsx` | `met` comes from the server, never inferred |
| `EvidencePanel` | `components/evidence.tsx` | a verdict without a link is an opinion |
| `SlaCell` | `components/evidence.tsx` | OVERDUE in words, not only in red |
| `VenueScope` / `VenueIdentity` | `components/scope.tsx` | venue is registry data (D5) |
| `ChartTile` + `envelopeCaption` | `components/chart.tsx` | the caption is the contract |
| `PanelState` / `PanelSkeleton` / `CommissionedPanel` / `CapNotice` | `components/states.tsx` | eight distinct claims, never one blank |
| `CommandPlanDrawer` | `components/drawer.tsx` | plan→apply→verify; 202 is not success |

Tests are behavioural, not snapshots: `execution.test.tsx` fails if PARTIAL turns
green, if canary loses its double border, if the skeleton enters the
accessibility tree, or if Apply reports only its first blocker.

## 5. Deltas found while building

Recorded so codex and a later reader see decisions, not drift. Screen-level
deltas live in `EXECUTION_SCALE_AND_REFINE.md` §7; these are the ones Phase 0
surfaced.

| # | Document says | Hi-fi / repo says | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | DS §4: AuthorityBadge takes "color from `--authority-*`, glyph per authority" | Every hi-fi renders EXECUTION / BROKER / DERIVED in the **same** tones — `#f4f4f4` for the word, `#6f6f6f` for the meta | Hi-fi wins (HANDOFF §3). Authority is carried by the WORD. A hue-coded authority is invisible to a reader who cannot separate hues, and this distinction is load-bearing. Two tokens instead of four. |
| P0-2 | DS §7 lists 16 Carbon values | The hi-fi also uses `#4c4c4c` (Carbon `border-strong`), 8 occurrences | Added as `--line-strong`. DS §7 is 16/17 complete, not wrong. |
| P0-3 | DS §7: typography is IBM Plex Sans / Mono | Neither fontsource package is installed, and the repo has no Node toolchain on the host | Font stack declares IBM Plex first with Inter/JetBrains as fallback, so structure is right and only the typeface differs. Adding the two packages is a lockfile change — **owner decision, see §7**. |
| P0-4 | `.editorconfig` exempts Markdown from trailing-whitespace trimming | The pre-commit hook's `git diff --cached --check` did not | `*.md text -whitespace` in `.gitattributes` (`4729163`). Code paths keep the check. |

---

## 6. Blocked on codex

**The one blocker that stops Phase 0 closing:**

> **Registry revision 3.** The hi-fi's nav groups are COMMAND / GOVERNANCE /
> DEPLOYMENTS / ADMINISTRATION; registry rev 2 has seven different groups and
> none named `governance`. The seventeen screens have no registry entries at
> all. Navigation renders from the registry by hard rule and `registry.json` is
> backend-owned, so the sidebar/topbar half of Phase 0 cannot be built.
>
> Frontend does not need the *data* — it needs the feature/screen/group entries
> and their canonical routes. A registry-only change unblocks phases 1–17's
> routing, independent of any Query API work.

**The fifteen contract requests** are specified in `EXECUTION_SCALE_AND_REFINE.md`
§5 with the UI consequence of each one's absence. Not yet formally sent —
waiting for the backend plan so they arrive as one set rather than piecemeal.

Highest-value two, if anything is picked up early:

- **BR-EX-14** (aggregate exposure per broker binding). Account/Broker 360°'s
  headroom sum is its safety claim, and one physical broker reference can back
  ~100 virtual accounts. Summed in the browser it is correct today and silently
  wrong the moment the table paginates.
- **BR-EX-02** (server-side filter/sort). Phases 1, 7 and 14 all describe
  filters as filtering rows. That reads as client-side, which is correct at 100
  rows and structurally wrong at 182,000.

---

## 7. Contract pack arrived — first reconciliation

`trading_system_portal_contract_pack/` landed 2026-08-21 09:31, while Phase 0
was being built. The discovery gate is closed: `extract/COVERAGE.json` reports
**15/15 COVERED**, `REDACTION-AUDIT.json` PASS over 70 files, no mutations.
Pin the gateway by image digest `sha256:4f63dc9949f8…`, not by git HEAD — the
running gateway is not built from the checked-out commit.

That makes it possible to check `contracts.ts` against runtime evidence rather
than against prose. First pass, using `extract/vocabularies.json`:

| Our type | Trading System evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `RuntimeState` = ACTIVE / REDUCING / HALTED / ARCHIVED | `strategy_deployments.state` and `portfolios.state` CHECK = ACTIVE / ARCHIVED / HALTED / REDUCING | **exact match** |
| `PromotionStage` = PAPER_OBSERVATION / SANDBOX_VALIDATION / LIVE_CANARY / LIVE_FULL | no `promotion_stage` column anywhere in 94 tables | **confirmed Portal-owned** — matches spec §23.2, which lists promotion stage as an additive gap. Ours to define. |
| `BrokerSync` = OK / STALE / MISMATCH / UNKNOWN | `account_sync_snapshots.status` CHECK = **ERROR** / MISMATCH / OK / STALE | **mismatch** — the real system has `ERROR`, we have `UNKNOWN`. `ERROR` must be added; whether `UNKNOWN` survives as a Portal-side "not yet observed" is a modelling decision, not a transcription one. |
| `mode` (paper/sandbox/live) | every mode column = backtest / live / paper / replay / sandbox | we render three of five; `backtest` and `replay` are Research-side and out of Execution scope |

Two things follow. The approach in §3 held up — three of four vocabularies were
right from the documents alone. And a **full reconciliation pass of
`contracts.ts` against `extract/` is now a real slice**, not speculation: 22
enums, 91 DB CHECKs, 124 reason codes and 85 payload models are sitting there to
check against, and doing it before seventeen screens are built on those types is
much cheaper than after.

## 8. Open for the owner

1. **IBM Plex fonts.** Two `@fontsource` packages, a lockfile change and a CI
   `npm audit` pass. Without them the Execution surface has Carbon's colour and
   geometry but Inter's letterforms — DS §7 calls the mono-forward type part of
   the identity, so this is a visible gap rather than a cosmetic one.
2. **Order/fill ratio** (carried from the scale pass): 1,000 per day across
   150–500 deployments is ~2–7 per deployment per day. Every blotter, event and
   workbench budget rests on it.
